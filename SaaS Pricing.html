    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>So far, my career experiences have been with groups, mostly unsuccessfully, attempting to build SaaS (Software as a Service) companies. Along with that, a large portion of my free time these days is devoted to building lifestyle businesses that have pieces that are highly software dependent.</p>
<p>This post therefore, is an attempt to  systematize some of my thoughts on SaaS models based on my experience and research. (I am by no means an expert on any of these things. Just a beginner who uses writing as a mechanism to clarify my thoughts). This part speaks about different SaaS Pricing models and a framework for deciding what model to pick based on reading and (very limited) personal experience.</p>
<h2>SaaS model types</h2>
<p>As the name suggests, SaaS reframes the way in which a company imagines its product lines and revenue streams. Instead of building a software solution and selling it as a one off product, a company sells software on a recurring basis (license or subscription). This allows them to model their revenues like a hedge fund models a financial instrument; an expected value of revenue as a function of customer data (acquisition rate , monetization rate , conversion rate, etc) .</p>
<p>SaaS companies have their own tradeoffs relative to product based companies, but for now, we're going to focus on this type of business model and work through different pricing types within the SaaS framework.</p>
<p>In this post, we're going to talk mainly about the different methods one can use to price their SaaS good (without worrying yet about how to assign a numerical value to that price). In the next part of this post, I'll talk more about actually deciding upon a price.</p>
<h3>Freemium</h3>
<p>In a freemium model, a company offers the core functionality of their product for free in a basic package.  The monetization strategy here is to attempt to convert some of those customers to paid ones by offering a premium version of the product that has more features (hence the name).  An easy example of this type of strategy is Spotify, which offers a free tier that allows customers to access the core functionality of the product but doesn't include features such as making playlists, ad free listening, or being able to select songs individually.</p>
<p>A freemium model work because a basic version of the product creates a low barrier to entry and serves as its own sort of marketing mechanism by generating interest. The logic is that people are unwilling to pay for experience based goods until they have properly assessed the value of them, which a free tier allows them to do.  </p>
<p>Within freemium, there are 4 popular ways to separate the free tier of your product with the premium tier:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capacity-based freemium-  access to the software product is restricted once a usage based threshold is passed. This usage can be something like storage space (Dropbox) or number of users (Slack) or something else along those lines. The idea is to align against a usage metric that you expect to grow if the user enjoys the product, thereby encouraging conversion to a paid service.</li>
<li>Feature-based freemium- This is the classic example of a basic version of the product being offered for free and then the premium version unlocking other features. Music streaming services like Spotify and Pandora are a good example of this. The goal once again is to select features that enhance the core offering in such a way that a user would be willing to pay for that added functionality, but to not restrict so many features that you end up damaging the core functionality of your basic free package.</li>
<li>Time-based freemium - the free trial strategy. We see companies like Netflix utilizing this for their offerings. In this, the entire product, with its full functionality, is offered, but on a trial basis.</li>
<li>Use-case-Based freemium- this is a less frequently utilized freemium type, but an example is Microsoft word or Matlab for students. College students (as a use case) get a free version of the product as long as they remain in school. This is an uncommon freemium pricing strategy, but it can be very useful if one knows their target customer.  For example, college students (like me) who were offered MatLab for free for use in our engineering and technical classes came to value it enough through years of usage that we were willing to pay for it once it stopped being a free option (to be clear, MatLab does not offer the product for free truly, it negotiates with universities to pay a fee. But the logic of utilizing this model if one is fairly sure of their target consumer still applies.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>All four of these freemium models are attacking the same issue from different angles;  how does a company create long term value from their free tier?  Which freemium type you should use (or whether you should even use a freemium model) is highly dependent on what sort of long term value you believe you can create for your customers.</p>
<p>First let's start with the market. Freemium is well known and used by many startups (often incorrectly) because of how obvious it sounds (and all the success story companies that have utilized it in the last decade) . But the freemium model is naturally well suited for very specific cases. As mentioned earlier, offering a free product that has an in demand core functionality generates interest and serves as its own sort of marketing (which if done correctly allows you to save money on sales-driven marketing). But  to me, this sort of strategy seems more useful in very specific contexts that we'll talk about below, due to specific tradeoffs.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1)  You add another step in generating cash flows, by needing to convert free customers into paying ones. By making your app free, you are naturally going to attract a class of customer that you can consider a free-rider.  To properly run a freemium model, you're going to need to have a strong conversion plan.  In most SaaS companies that use pure freemium models, 5 percent of the entire customer base pays for the 95 percent of the free riders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2)  Even if you have a very strong and successful conversion strategy, its unlikely to be more than a 4-5 percent conversion percentage, as some of the best companies in the world have shown (Box, Pandora, MailChimp, Evernote, LinkedIn, Skype, etc.) As an aside, Spotify is a glaring exception here, boasting a 26.6 percent conversion rate in 2015. Out of 75 million monthly users, 20 million were paying customers.  But Spotify seems to be a unicorn among unicorns with regards to conversion metrics (e.g. Dropbox has a 4 percent conversion rate) and also operates in a gigantic market (100-150 million monthly active users).  The general limitations of conversion rates being in the low single digits probably still apply to the field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3)  Conversion rates are small, but time to conversion can also be slow. For example,  It could take 6-7 months on average to convert free customers into paid ones. During that time, you are taking a loss on every single customer who uses your products. These marginal costs could manifest themselves in bandwidth and data costs (as SaaS is clearly centrally hosted, you are accruing the cost) but could also manifest themselves in areas such as customer support, extraneous services, and other human related elements. These losses could be exaggerated or contained based on the industry you operate in and/or how much funding you have. This is not to even speak of the initial fixed cost of developing your software or the customer acquisition costs that you will need to spend at the beginning. While freemium lets you not focus on targeted sales, you still have to spend money to market your product.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These points are meant to elucidate that  in a freemium model, you are assuming initial risk by making your product free, attracting a large swath of customers who are mostly freeloaders (e.g. me with Evernote or Pandora), and spending a lot of money while you wait for a few of them to become valuable paying customers who provide the capital necessary to sustain the rest of your customer base. Along with that, you have to be sure of your unit economics. That is, how are your costs going to scale when you go from 5 free customers to 100 free customers? With software, the marginal costs of distribution are zero, but if you are running a cloud service, or a highly computation based service (eg distributed computing, MLaaS companies, etc), or a service that only partially utilizes software, you would have to be sure you could survive many free customers using your product at the same time.</p>
<p>The benefits that you accrue are.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1) an opportunity to rapidly scale up if your product is good.  This implies that you should be in a market where rapidly scaling up is possible i.e. there are many many potential users waiting for a product like yours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2) If you can manage your costs effectively, and you are operating in an industry where you address a significant pain point,  you can quickly establish a foothold in the market. Not all of the people comprising of that foothold will be good (paying) customers however but it still gives you leverage in taking the next step of building a conversion strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are in a business where network effects are valuable and the market is extremely large, you can gain value quickly. In this sort of case, a freemium model is advantageous as you will be able to find funding that allows you to support your initial losses (see Silicon Valley).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If one looks at the benefits and the contexts, you start to see that an ideal freemium model is meant for a business that needs to rapidly achieve scale, has high initial funding that can sustain them for a long period of time on conversion, is in an industry where the user base is virtually limitless in size, and has a product that is simple to use, even if it is something novel. Take facebook for example. While facebook does not use a traditional freemium model, one can see the ideal characteristics. The user base was capped basically only by the population of the world with an internet connection, the software was novel and addressed many real pain points and brought a lot of value to its potential customers at inception (networking college students) and was intuitive and easy to use. We can go back to the Spotify example and see the same characteristics. This does not mean that freemium is only useful for billion dollar plus companies, but in general if the market is too niche or too small, or your product is too complicated, you are playing with fire using a freemium model.  </p>
<p>If you do decide to use a freemium model, the important thing to remember is that you have to find a way to extract some value from your free customers as early as possible. This could be advertising based (as Spotify, or facebook does. Facebook doesn't even require a paid tier due to the strength of their targeted advertising and natural network effects) . It could also be product development based. One could utilize their free tier customers to learn more about how their product functions, where to make changes, and understand how to maximize their conversion rate by iterating their product from that information.</p>
<h3>Consumption Based Model</h3>
<p>Also known as the pay as you go model. Unlike freemium, the software is charged completely on a usage level. The cost is usually tied to some small charge per denomination of usage. Like a taxi service, which meters cost per a mile (or kilometer of usage), Consumption services do the same. There are many different consumption metrics you can tie price against (depends on your business needs) but this model is pretty straight forward. Prominent software examples are companies like Twilio (charges 2 cents per call) or AWS (charges a couple cents per computation).  </p>
<p>Perhaps some throw in a fixed initial cost, but at their essence all consumption based pricing models are like a taxi meter.</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>So, how do you know whether a consumption based pricing model is useful for you? The first, most obvious point is to gauge whether you have a business built on some unit of measurement that you can make price a function of.  Going back to the taxi example, we easily see that a taxi business has a steady unit of measurement (distance) that they can charge against effectively. For them, it makes no sense to charge a flat rate for a taxi ride, or to come up with some order sort of pricing measure. They don't price a taxi by number of people sitting in the car (usually) and they don't charge pre-ride. Your company would have to have a similar sort of metric that you can price against usage wise to utilize this sort of model. Along with that, you should be extremely sure of your own unit costs, as determining the price you charge per unit is going to determine your long term profitability.</p>
<p>It has some benefits, mainly around ease of access for the customer. Similar to a free offering , if your cost of usage is low enough, companies may be interested in trying the product out for a limited time. This gives them a level of control over their usage that they don't necessarily have in a licensing or subscription model, especially in B2B enterprise where there is usually a long term lock in. Conversely, the tradeoff is that your revenues are less  predictable, as companies have no restrictions to leaving your platform. This is a tradeoff that is expected. More flexibility and less lock in means less predictability on your end.</p>
<p>This was the case at a  financial software startup I used to work at.  The company's software platform was aimed ensuring regulatory compliance for large insurance companies and banks. One aspect of regulatory compliance (specifically for banks) involves flagging potentially fraudulent transactions (perhaps related to terrorist financing, drug money, or at a smaller scale even illegal wire transfers.  The modern financial transfer system is like a large interlocked network, with small amounts of money flowing in different directions constantly, thanks to the transition to mobile payments. For big banks with a high volume of transactions daily (e.g. Bank of America which could do millions of  individual transactions daily) it was nearly impossible to retroactively check whether each transaction. This particular company had created a software platform that was able to handle that sort of daily transaction load.</p>
<p>For large banks in New York such as Bank of America,  a consumption model was unfeasible, as those banks lock in software contractors for two to three years for legal and financial reasons. However,  there was a target customer for whom a consumption model made sense; Mid sized banks with a sufficiently high volume of transactions, but a lack of incentive or capital to lock in a pricey perpetual license for usage. For them, we could price per batch of transactions monitored (per 1000 transactions) and they could utilize us. If they felt the need to utilize us further or at a higher usage, we could lock them in. There were other aspects of the software models that we explored making usage based for mid size banks and insurance companies (due diligence, case management) as well.</p>
<p>As you can see, in this example there was once again a clear metric of usage that we could price against (batch transactions) and there was also a consumer interest in pricing against that metric. This brings to me my broader point about the consumption model. It should be both advantageous for your company, and offer some sort of consumer benefit. These two factors, along with a strong understanding of your own unit costs, are pre-requisites for utilizing this pricing model.</p>
<h2>Tiered Model.</h2>
<p>The most popular SaaS model, and in some ways similar to a freemium model.  This one is pretty self explanatory, you segment your product offering into tiers (basic, intermediate, advanced) which you tie to price charged.</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Because the tiered model is so common, and is so intuitive, I think there are a lot of issues around how to implement it. The key with tiers is to segment your offerings properly. This includes not only  segmenting against value metrics that can be analyzed, but also keeping intangible factors such as "customer expectation of service" and "time spent" in mind.</p>
<h4>What is the role of your tiers?</h4>
<p>My mental frame is to think of tiers as a guidepost. You want to utilize pricing and tiers to herd/guide your customers to a specific point.</p>
<p>Where you guide them depends completely on your own pricing strategy and how you value your offerings. However, we can speak generally.</p>
<p>In a general framework, you want your highest pricing tier to establish value for your product. There are plenty of studies showing that this is used to set a psychological "break point" in your customers head;  it is more so useful in reference to your middle tier.  As a result, this should be priced as highly as you can get away with. I think it makes sense to think of this tier as niche. Whatever you're offering here should be specifically aimed at the top tier of customers in your industry and be very highly optimized towards them. The middle tier offers the best mix of price and value, while the lowest tier is usually a gateway to an up-sell, where you eventually convert the majority of your users into the middle tier.  </p>
<p>There are, of course, many other ways to think about tiers. You can obviously have more than 3 tiers. How you price tiers also depends upon your overall positioning in the market (e.g. ultra niche high scale or high volume low scale).  We'll talk a little bit more about how to organize offerings into tiers later on in the second and third parts of this post.</p>
<h4>Tradeoffs</h4>
<p>But first I want to address some general tradeoffs with the tiered pricing model. These are meant to inform a context in which to utilize tiered pricing. The biggest advantage of a tiered model is reach. If you segment your market correctly (big if) , you have a much wider scope of customer, and critically, you are gaining adequate value on all of them. At a single flat price, you are locking in your consumers demand at an average value. If you imagine your customers demand as a surface, you are assuming this surface is relatively flat, when in reality, it could be full of mountains and valleys. This is to say that some customers could value a specific functionality in your product at a far greater price than other customers, and vice versa. At a flat price, you cannot take advantage of such asymmetries. Tiering your offerings gives you the chance; the key however is still to determine what those  asymmetries are.</p>
<p>We can take the example of the fitness industry, one  that I am currently trying to build a business in. Fitness is a prime example of an industry in which there are different customer geographies. There are some people who really value losing weight, who would be willing to pay much more for a program that is focused exclusively on weight loss. There are some experts who are looking for very specific training and nutrition regiments, perhaps to train for a marathon, or to gain muscle for a fight. And then there are normal people, who perhaps value a standard routine that gives them a set structure and a coach who instills discipline in them.</p>
<p>These different types of customer value levels indicate a marketplace that has a very uneven geography. This means, in my opinion, that a tiered system makes more sense, as you can segment your offering very uniquely based on the customer's values, and operate in different price ranges.</p>
<p>In this situation however, we stumble upon another tradeoff. All the relevant research and experiment has shown that customers get highly confused and unmotivated to purchase if given too many options. There seems to be an in-built mental fatigue that comes from too many choices. This makes sense to me, as it screams of laziness on the business's part as they are offloading the work of pricing onto the consumer.   And here we get to what I see as the fundamental tradeoff with tiered pricing models. The fundamental differences in value at a customer level can be vast, but trying to address that vastness head on creates a level of complexity that discourages sales.</p>
<p>I think there are many industries in which the geographic landscape of what the customer values is uneven. In theory a tiered pricing model makes sense for almost all of them, but the difficulty lies in determining exactly what metric(s) to segment  the market against. Ultimately it is up to the company to gauge which aspects each customer values the most, and segment their offering in a simple way (3-4 tiers maximum) in order to reflect that. To go back to the fitness example, it is up to our team to do market research, and segment the market based on certain values or characteristics that we believe customers will pay a premium for. An uneven customer geography does not mean that you can offload value decision making onto the customer.  In most industries, you are not dealing with a high enough level of customer sophistication to introduce a high pricing complexity, especially for a SaaS company. There are differences in one off products like cars, which have many many add ons as they are infrequent buys and you can count on a level of customer sophistication.</p>
<p>I believe that platforms that have many features are heavily vulnerable to this tier decision problem. At the financial software company I previously worked at, a full regulatory compliance software suite was built. This was meant to be an all encompassing software suite to manage every aspect of compliance for financial services and insurance.  Pardon my bias, but it was an extremely well designed piece of software that covered almost every use case a major financial institution would utilize in its day to day compliance work.</p>
<p>But pricing was offloaded to the consumer. In enterprise, this is actually more common than you think, as big companies utilize leverage to negotiate their own licensing deals, especially with startups. Financial institutions are heavily protected industries as well, where a small startup does not have the sort of bargaining power to decide pricing optimally. Still, at my time there, I felt very strongly that a tiered pricing system would work much better than the modular flexible "decide your own price" system that was being considered at the time. From sitting in meetings with potential banks and customers, it felt like the flexibility aspect was introducing a level of complexity into it that had significant mental costs. In hindsight, my advice at the time would have been to create pricing tiers based on significant features, have the options of add-ons, and then create an enterprise customizable tier as the top tier that was completely customizable but at a very high price. In this framework, the very large financial institutions would prefer the high price tier anyway, but lower level banks, especially regional and local, would be able to price themselves into a specific tier without thinking too deeply about which features fit their budget. This is not to say that tiered pricing was the only way to go in that company, there were aspects of a consumption model that were considered for specific compliance functions. But within tiers, this level of flexibility led to many problems.</p>
<p>This is the central issue with tiered models in my opinion. Flexibility begets complexity. Too much complexity will lead to customers ignoring your project. The key in tiered pricing is to have a very good idea of how to segment your market, and which value axes to prioritize.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This (extremely long) post was meant to cover some of the contexts and tradeoffs of the 3 most popular and high level SaaS models.  In the next part of the post, we'll talk about a framework to decide what SaaS pricing model to pick, and then delve a bit deeper into how to segment the market for basic/premium offerings and tiered pricing offerings.</p>

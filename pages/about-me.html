  <div>
    <p>My name is Nikhil Prasad, and I am a recent engineering physics graduate from the
University of Michigan. My intellectual interests lie in defensive technologies,
machine learning/data science, computational biology, and some of the interesting
intersections of these fields.</p>
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>My collegiate background is a mixture of a classical physics undergraduate degree
with a materials engineering focus. I originally went into University aiming
to get a chemical engineering degree, and I wanted to focus on alternative energy,
specifically energy storage solutions. After realizing that chemical engineering was more
process driven and more about preparing students for careers working in applying techniques
in factories or large plants, I changed my major to Materials science and
engineering during my sophomore year. A year of coursework later I realized that
a lot of undergraduate materials science was too surface level, and that I would need
a deep physics background to understand and/or accomplish breakthrough changes in energy.
With that I switched my major once again, to Engineering Physics, which was a joint program offered
between the physics department at the University of Michigan and the Engineering school.
I ended up graduating nearly 5 and a half years after entering the
University of Michigan Engineering school, having taken some time off to work on interesting
opportunities.</p>
<p>Currently I am interested in working in data science and or machine learning. Though my
overall interest in energy has not waned, at some point in college, mainly after taking some energy policy courses, I
realized that energy in the US was a "wicked problem". It also seemed to be that a lot of the alternative energy sources I was
interested in implementing had their own tradeoffs (e.g. Biofuels). Realizing that the issues were structural,
I decided to focus more of my time on my other interests that I felt I could make more headway in at this point in my life.</p>
<p>Currently I spend most of my time learning about the three aforementioned areas: defensive technologies, which
mostly means cryptography currently, computation biology, and data analysis and machine learning. I think there
are some very interesting intersection points within the three fields, specifically in secure DNA analysis, machine
learning on large scale genome datasets, information theory in DNA encoding, and computational drug discovery, to
name a few. Currently those are more of my focus.</p>
<p>This personal website is a mixture of blog and work portfolio documenting my
journey to learn as much about those fields as possible, and presenting some of
the work I am doing.</p>
<p>You can reach me at prnikhil@umich.edu</p>
<h1>Skills</h1>
<p>I have experience in: databases, both relational (SQLlite, PostgresSQL, interacting with SQL stores using python) and
non-relational (MongoDB). webscraping using beautifulsoup,</p>
<h1>Relevant Coursework</h1>
<p>Standard Physics curriculum.  </p>

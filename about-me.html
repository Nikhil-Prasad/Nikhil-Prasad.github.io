  <div>
    <p>My name is Nikhil Prasad, and I am a recent engineering physics graduate from the
University of Michigan. My intellectual interests lie in defensive technologies,
machine learning/data science, computational biology, and some of the interesting
intersections of these fields.</p>
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>My collegiate background is a mixture of a classical physics undergraduate degree
with a materials engineering focus. I originally went into University aiming
to get a chemical engineering degree, and I wanted to focus on alternative energy,
specifically energy storage solutions. After realizing that chemical engineering was more
process driven and more about preparing students for careers working in applying techniques
in factories or large plants, I changed my major to Materials science and
engineering during my sophomore year. A year of coursework later I realized that
a lot of undergraduate materials science was too surface level, and that I would need
a deep physics background to understand and/or accomplish breakthrough changes in energy.
With that I switched my major once again, to Engineering Physics, which was a joint program offered
between the physics department at the University of Michigan and the Engineering school.
I ended up graduating nearly 5 and a half years after entering the
University of Michigan Engineering school, having taken some time off to work on an interesting opportunity
at a financial software startup named SurveilLens.</p>
<p>I spent about a year working at surveilLens, taking time off from school to compensate. My work initially started off as doing marketing for the company's software platform, which was aimed at aiding large banks and financial services firms with legal and regulatory compliance. The platform was modular, and had various different submodules aimed around different regulatory functions such as due diligence, transaction monitoring, and case management. My work was around segmenting the market, making a target list of companies that would be interested in different functions within the platform, and deciding how to best reach them. During the course of that work I cold called and cold emailed many people, web scraped data, creating marketing channels, worked with distribution and business partners, created technical marketing documents and helped rebuild the website to incorporate some of the new marketing and business strategy.</p>
<p>Later on my work changed more so towards product development and research. The company was working towards building a
network analysis tool aimed at combating healthcare fraud. The goal was to use an underlying graph database and various
sorts of network and graph search algorithms to create a way to track types of medicare and medicaid fraud. My role was to
interface with the software team on the architecture of this software, mainly because of my previous experience with graph
theory in some of my classes, and my comfort level with the math and algorithm knowledge to explain how certain aspects of
network analysis would work. This portion of my work lasted about 4 months, and a product beta was built.</p>
<p>Currently I am interested in working in data science and or machine learning. Though my overall interest in energy has not waned, at some point in college, mainly after taking some energy policy courses, I realized that energy in the US was a "wicked problem". It also seemed to be that a lot of the alternative energy sources I was interested in implementing had their own tradeoffs (e.g. Biofuels). Realizing that the issues were structural,I decided to focus more of my time on my other interests that I felt I could make more headway in at this point in my life.</p>
<p>Currently I spend most of my time learning about the three aforementioned areas: defensive technologies, which
mostly means cryptography at the moment, computational biology, and machine learning. I think there
are some very interesting intersection points within the three fields, specifically in secure DNA analysis, machine
learning on large scale genome datasets, information theory in DNA encoding, and computational drug discovery, to
name a few.</p>
<p>This personal website is a mixture of a blog and work portfolio documenting my journey to learn as much about those fields as possible, and presenting some of the work I am doing.</p>

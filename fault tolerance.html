    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The modern technology era has been defined by the rise of distributed computing.  Applications as diverse as parallel computing, the internet, wireless and mesh networks,  mobile networks, aircraft telemetry, and Bitcoin require distributed systems knowledge.  Companies such as Google, Uber,  and Amazon all utilize a large swatch of computers that work together in order to complete tasks.  The growth of distributed systems in computing has led to a rich background of research around problem types within these types of systems. The rise of Bitcoin and decentralized systems is leading to another layer of research interest.</p>
<p>Distributed systems have their own share of implementation and theoretical issues.  In this post, I'm going to speak briefly about one of those problems that interests me: the Byzantine General's Problem.</p>
<p>Let's start by defining a distributed system and its purpose. We can generally classify these systems as a group of semi-autonomous computers that operate together by communicating and coordinating in order to fulfill a global task.  One can think of these computers as nodes in a graph. Like in a graph, these nodes can have varying degrees of freedom (their own hardware or software or rules).  In a distributed computing system, there is usually an ultimate goal at hand that the system is supposed to achieve.  As an example, Google could be utilizing a server farm with 5000 computers in order to execute all the search queries it gets. Google could have different computers set up different functions of its search engine process i.e. some computers could just have the role of searching the web for HTML links (GoogleBot), and some focused on just indexing all the links into an ordered list (PageRank) and some focused just on returning the data to the User.  In reality, google's early architecture was much more complex than this and had many more moving parts.</p>
<p>From google's standpoint we can easily see that nodes will be required to share resources and  information, communicate, and coordinate with each other in order to solve a common goal.  PageRank computers would need information from GoogleBot and the computers sending data back to the user would need information from everyone else. This is the paradigm that all distributed systems operate under.  And in this paradigm, there are a whole host of new motivations and problems. This was back in 1998. Today, the distributed systems paradigm has permeated throughout most of the technology world. Both large and small scale technology companies rely on distributed computing platforms like AWS to run their business operations. You also see the ideas underlying distributed systems reaching enterprise grade technology in all of the big companies in the world as they </p>
<p>Some of  these issues are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communication- what sort of protocol do you design to allow nodes to communicate? What limitations and costs come with this communication protocol?</li>
<li>Latency- how much time does it take for data to be shared within nodes?</li>
<li>Network Topology-  the distributed system is not static, there are constantly computers, servers, processors, etc being added or taken out. How does data and messaging transfer change?</li>
<li>Coordination- how do you best coordinate nodes with different resources in order to complete a global task as efficiently as possible.</li>
<li>Synchronization- how do nodes and their processes achieve a shared state of time, specifically in order to compute tasks in a certain order?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just some of the many issues pertaining to efficiency in distributed systems. Going in depth on all of them would require writing a textbook, but I think the general takeaway from these issues is to understand that distributed systems bring an inherent uncertainty about system state with them. Nodes within the network inherently do not have certainty about the actions or state of any other nodes at a given moment, yet it is necessary for them to coordinate in order to execute global tasks. This uncertainty leads to a large class of problem types within distributed systems</p>
<p>Another class of problems with distributed system is fault tolerance.  A fault can be defined as any malfunction or deviation from the expected behavior of a node within a distributed system. We can divide faults firstly into 3 different types: transient, intermittent, and permanent. These are fairly self explanatory, and are subdivided on the degree of time that the fault lasts. Another subdivision of faults is fail stop and byzantine. Fail stop faults cause a processor or node to die and stop participating in the distributed system's task at hand. Byzantine faults are ones where a node is faulty, but continues producing information but the information is either incorrect or malevolent in some way.</p>
<p>From this, it follows that you want distributed systems to both be optimized for avoiding faults but also be fault tolerant in case they still occur (which they will: the real world is full of cases you cannot plan for :) ) . A system is fault tolerant then, if it can sustain itself and complete its task even with a reasonable number of its nodes failing.  Unlike a centralized system, where a program is being executed on only one computer, a distributed system can finish a global task even if some of the nodes exhibit faults, or failures. The remaining nodes can divide up the work and complete the task, provided they can communicate and reach a consensus.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem in the  fault tolerance of a distributed system based on message passing between nodes is that of establishing consensus. In fail stop fault tolerance, nodes that are faulty simply stop working and consensus can easily be retained, as the system realizes that a node is faulty as soon as it stops transmitting messages. However, in distributed systems with message passing, Byzantine faults become extremely problematic.  The Byzantine Generals problem models why such consensus is so difficult in synchronous networks (networks where messages are relayed in a set amount of time).  We'll start by talking about this message passing issue through the two generals problem.</p>
<h2>Consensus and The Two Generals Problem</h2>
<p>As previously implied, consensus between functioning nodes in a network is vital in solving fault tolerance. We have already touched on how there in uncertainty in the state of a distributed system, and this creates confusion for nodes in regards to figuring out the "faultiness" of the nodes around it.  The Byzantine Generals' Problem is an attempt to analogize this consensus problem in distributed computing (written by Lamport et al in 1982).</p>
<p>We'll start by looking at the two generals problem to get an idea about what uncertainty in a distributed system could look like. The two generals problem is a hypothetical that illustrates how coordination between individuals or nodes becomes impossible if we rely  on communication over unreliable channels.</p>
<h3>Two Generals Setup</h3>
<p>In the traditional set up, two generals, each with their own army, are separately camped outside a fortified city in separate valleys. A third valley separates the two armies' encampments; this valley has defenders from the city stationed there.  The two generals have agreed that they will attack the city, but they have not agreed upon a time of attack. It is necessary for them to attack at the same time in order to actually conquer the heavily fortified city, so they must attack at exactly the same time. Unfortunately, the only way they can agree on a time now is to send messengers back and forth through the third valley. However they have no way of knowing whether or not the messenger has been intercepted by one of the city's defenders already camped there.</p>
<p>The setup of this can be varied. For example, one could imagine the two generals camped on opposite sides of the fortified city and the messenger having to pass through the city, where he could be intercepted as well. The point is to create a scenario in which communication is only possible with an unreliable communication channel. The goal of the generals is to find a way to reach a consensus on a time to attack just by sending messengers to each other.</p>
<p>There are no absolute solutions to the Two Generals Problem that lead to the consensus that is needed to act. It is simple to illustrate why this is the case; let us say the first general sends a message with a time. He now has no certainty about whether or not this messenger actually reached the 2nd general. The 2nd general can remedy this by sending his own messenger back to the first general with confirmation that he received the message, but then he has no confirmation that his messenger reached. This loop repeats itself ad infinitum.</p>
<p>There are probabilistic solutions to the two generals problem, where one or both of the generals can gain a high degree of confidence that everyone is on the same page. But the point of this problem was to explicate the issues surrounding consensus in a distributed system. One can clearly translate this generals analogy to a situation with two nodes where the validity of the messages between them is not clear at best, or intercepted by the a malevolent party as worst. It shows the simplest case of what can happen in a poorly designed two node system where message passing is the primary means of consensus. Systems can be thrown into infinite loops or can crash.</p>
<p>The goal of the byzantine generals problem is to expand this two generals problem (two node setup) to multiple generals in order to reach a mathematical threshold at which we can assume some consensus in a network. In the next part we'll focus on that set up and the definitions necessary for it.</p>

    <p>In the last part, I gave a high-level view of the prominent SaaS pricing models. This  part delves deeper into the decision making processes around SaaS Pricing.</p>
<h2>End Points</h2>
<p>Price (and the model around it)  is an endpoint. It is a function of your knowledge about your customer, what value you provide to them, and your place in the market.   It means that you've figured out as much as possible about your business and its market position.  This is extremely difficult because knowledge in any market is opaque.</p>
<p>I think of this as an optimization problem. Perhaps a better analogy is gradient descent in machine learning. To keep it non-technical, think of the process of pricing as trying to navigate down a mountain. You are at the top of a mountain at night. It is pitch black and all you have is a flashlight that allows you to see forward a few feet. If your goal is to get down to the base of the mountain, one way to do so effectively is to point your flashlight towards the ground, and follow the steepest downward incline slowly for a few steps. Periodically you stop and check again to see if you're following the steepest incline. Eventually, by continuing to optimize your rate of descent, you should reach the bottom of the mountain (with some caveats that are not relevant here). Pricing works the same way; think of your optimal price as being at the "bottom of the mountain". In SaaS, it makes sense to pick a price, learn from your customers about the efficacy of that price. More critically, learn how they value the product, and then continue shifting that price slowly. That becomes your process of "descending down the mountain".</p>
<p>To summarize, pricing is an iterative process that requires constant shifting based on information you receive from talking to your customers. However, your initial price should be a solid starting point.  As mentioned before, this requires having as good of an understanding of the market and your business as possible before entering the iterative stages.</p>
<h2>Three Common Pricing strategies</h2>
<p>There are 3 ways to think about setting your price:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cost Plus Based Pricing- in this pricing framework, a company calculates its variable costs to some degree of certainty, and then adds some margin to that in order to create profit (usually 15-20 percent). This sort of pricing model is common in commodity industries, where the value of a good is set in some sort of equilibrium. Gasoline is an example of a product that is cost plus priced and all competitors kind of aggregate around that price. Commodity industries create enormous downward price pressure, as competitors will continue to undercut each other in a brutal race to the bottom (with some caveats about markets and monopolies). In this sort of industry, margins are small, and you need scale to achieve profitability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Competitor Based Pricing-  This one is self-explanatory. You base your pricing on competition in the industry.  Dynamics of this are present in every industry, one can look at consumer cars and their model lines as an example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Value-Based Pricing-  This is the type of pricing model that was described above, where the focus is clearly on determining what value you provide to your customer, and pricing against that.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Cost based and competitor based pricing are tangentially useful for SaaS companies, but they aren't the right fit.  SaaS is unique because of how differentiated software can be.  A SaaS Company that wants to be successful should have a sufficient degree of differentiation as  it is critical that it serves its own niche.  If you are not sufficiently differentiated from the rest of the market within your industry, then you are already doomed to fail, especially if you are trying to reach scale.  This is not to imply that you should not be analyzing your competition, but to suggest that competition in the software industry is usually a death sentence, especially if you are a small player attacking a large market. If you are in an industry where your product is similar to someone else already in the field, you need to quickly find a point of differentiation that appeals to customers. Otherwise, you will continue to lack competitive advantage.</p>
<p>This is an issueI I faced at the financial software company mentioned in the previous post. Our software platform, while being targeted at financial institutions, was very similar in its technological scope to Palantir. This caused us problems, as companies would ask what differentiated us from Palantir, and our truthful answer was that we were a less advanced version of them that could be offered at a much cheaper rate (Palantir charge upwards of a million dollar per month for their product line and has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in product development. We had spent hundreds of thousands...in order to give you an idea of the resource difference). Our point of differentiation eventually became shifting the product to be a complete suite of compliance resources aimed at mid-sized insurance companies and banks that were underserved by existing software companies.  Here we could find success as there were few (if any) players that had adequately built software targeting these banks, yet there was still a need.</p>
<p>This example should also elucidate how your market positioning  is an input of pricing. Price was our endpoint. We only formalized it after we had gone to many customer meetings and learned more about where exactly our ideal market position was.</p>
<p>While competitor based pricing is a useful exercise to do for SaaS, but ultimately flawed is that SaaS is ideally noncompetitive. You want to  serve your own niche of customers who are loyal to you because you are differentiated on some vector. Otherwise, you provide no incentives for customers to utilize your service.</p>
<p>Cost plus based pricing is also flawed for SaaS,  because it undercuts your profit margin mistaking customers assumptions. In a commodity-based industry, there is downward pressure on your prices that exists due to  competitors continuing to reduce their profit margin down near cost. This causes the equilibrium price to settle at some point just above costs (unless there are monopoly or duopoly situations where supply is controlled by only one or two parties.).</p>
<p>Software on the other hand, especially highly differentiated software, is not a commodity. Customers don't care about the costs that you incur, and your aim is to offer something differentiated enough that they cannot get it anywhere else. In reality, that is the fundamental reason that both cost-plus based and customer based pricing are bad fits for SaaS; your differentiation level makes it so that your ideal customers are coming because you provide value that no one else can. And your price should be reflective of that value. Think of cost-plus based and competitor based pricing as "checks" for the value you ascribe to your product, not fundamental markers to decide what your product is worth.</p>
<p>So value-based pricing it is. This leads us to our next question. How do you determine the value your customers accrue? We discussed this at a high level in the previous section, but I want to delve more into details.</p>
<h2>Valuable Considerations</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the endpoints section, you start off your value-based pricing by getting as close to what you think the ideal value is, and then iterating from there.</p>
<p>There are certain things you must begin with for deciding value. The first and most critical one is your ideal customer. You can have different ideal customers for different product offerings (if you sell multiple product lines) but before you can understand the value you offer, you have to understand the customers that you are offering it to.</p>
<p>Understanding your ideal customer is a function of understanding your product.  When you built your product, who were you targeting? What problem were you actually trying to solve? This is the most critical point. A lot of times, as software developers or product development people, we get lost in features and ancillary nonsense. And as business people, we get lost in metrics (ARR, LTV, etc). These are clearly important (and they come later in the stack), but the key thing you are trying to do is to solve a problem. Your product/service offers a "means" for them to achieve this goal, to solve this problem.</p>
<p>At the earliest stages of your company, before you have factored in customer acquisition costs, and built a marketing funnel, figured out churn, etc, you have to factor your pricing as a function of your ideal customer.</p>
<p>I'll explain it with an example. I am currently attempting to build a fitness business that is not technically a SaaS company but has so many software elements that I will call it software adjacent.  This is a business that I am building with my friend, who is a competitive powerlifter who has gone from being very much out of shape to someone who is an athlete. He and I have spent a lot of time talking about motivation and fitness, and out of that a desire to build a small personal training business was born. We are currently in the beginning stages, with the product and plans developed, and 5 paying customers, but are workshopping our ideal customers and price. We have developed a roadmap to a lot of features for a software-based workout and nutrition calendar app that allows for direct communication with him as a personal trainer, but are not sure exactly what features each customer would or would not like to use.</p>
<p>During our discussions on pricing our product, we both decided that  our competitors (remote training and workout apps and programs) were a waste of time because they did not solve the problem that most people who signed up were looking for. Or rather, we did not want our ideal customer to be someone who paid 5-10 dollars a month for a bullshit app that gave you workouts  you could find for free online and cookie-cutter nutrition information. We also felt that high quality fitness apps, like dating apps, should have a natural churn. Once you get into the shape that you want (or found the person that you wanted to date), you leave. This is a difficult thing to accept, but ideally, we did not want people paying us 10 dollars a month for years on end with minimal results (aka most gyms and fitness programs in the market). These were not people we wanted to be our customers.  In our minds, there were a class of people that were desperate to be in the best shape of their lives, whether this involved becoming an athlete, or going from obese to slim. These people, the ones that found their physical level lacking, and were looking for a real solution were the ones that we wanted to frame as our ideal customers. We felt that  their value of a service that could get them physically self-sufficient in a set time frame would be astronomical.  We decided that we wanted to create a program that was fixed cost (hence not actually a recurring service) that guaranteed results within 6 months. We would cut everyone else out because we did not want to target them. This also allowed us to charge at such a price (1000+ dollars over the six months) that we could build out the services that we felt would make us capable of actually delivering on this six-month promise.</p>
<p>This meant our ideal price was a fixed cost of 1000-1500 dollars for this service. This was the "starting point" that we'd decided, basically just from my friend's experience as a personal trainer, and the conversations we had with potential customers, plus competitor analysis. We also did a quick cost analysis in order to set a floor. To refer back to the 3 models, this is how a SaaS (or SaaS adjacent business) would utilize cost-based pricing and competitor based pricing. They are just informational tools for your value-based assessment of your product. Our value assessment was based on our ideal customer profile, which was based on their "problem to be solved".</p>
<p>This price was the "top of our mountain", to refer back to the gradient descent analogy. Our goal now was to optimize it, and to further segment our customer profile(we are still in the process of doing this).</p>
<p>The way to go about this is external. You have to communicate with customers and continuously adapt your prices and (if you're using a tiered model like we plan to) tiers based on feedback.</p>
<p>Process-wise, the way to do this is in cohorts. Take a time frame (usually 3-6 months) and batch your customers within that time frame.  We picked 6 as it fits nicely with our product description of 6 months to self-sufficiency and decided to go after 5-10 people that all had our "ideal customer problem" i.e. I want to get into the best shape of my life and have it last.  </p>
<p>The initial step was reaching out to people within our own networks who we knew fit that ideal customer profile. Within 2 weeks we had 5 paying customers. The first one we started a bit lower and asked for 450 dollars for the 6 months, which we were ok with because it was very early in the process. Once we had a commitment from him, we started bumping the price up 10-15 percent for each successive customer to see how far we could go (this is the optimization step). We eventually reached a tentative commitment at 900 dollars over the 6 months.</p>
<p>Obviously, the price can be further optimized. Optimization is best executed as a two-step process. The first step is within cohorts (as I explained above). The second step is about learning user behaviors and applying the knowledge to segment your market. We do not expect everyone who shares the "ideal customer problem" to have the same "path" to getting there. That is to say, that while all of our first cohort customers want the same thing out of this process, they have different methods. We have positioned ourselves to target customers that value a specific result , and have a host of features aimed at achieving that result (personalized exercise plans based on fitness level, body fat and weight management, hormonal management, DNA analysis for exercise, motivational content, in-depth nutritional guides broken down by metabolic effectiveness, targeted day by day workouts, direct personal trainer access, form analysis, etc) . By picking a diverse cohort, we naturally see which  features are most used by which group.</p>
<p>This allows us to naturally create buyer personas based on feature usage. Tiers (if you use them) should not be arbitrarily segmented, but segmented against your knowledge of how users utilize your product. As you see which buyers utilize what features more than others, you can naturally start segmenting your product based on buyer personas. Then you can map price to the customer geography. This is our plan for the next 6 months.</p>
<p>I spoke very much about this fitness example in order to give a real-world use case of how I think about pricing over time. To formalize it, when you think of pricing as an endpoint, you should follow these steps in rough order:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1) Begin with market research on your ideal users and what problem you are solving for them. Build a value based pricing judgement from that judgment.  Use cost-plus based pricing and competitor based pricing to set guideposts for that judgment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2) Figure out your axes of differentiation and where you position yourself in the market. For us, it is our guarantee for self-sufficiency within 6 months Your own business could be at a completely different place in your respective market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3) Find people who have your ideal problem, and position yourself to be their solution. This is a topic deep enough to be its own post. To keep it brief, I search for customers whose need is very apparent (e.g. out of shape and motivated to change for our business), and are actively looking for solutions. In our early stages, this involves us reaching out into our networks and finding people who fit this profile, but for any company, this is going to require SEO on one end (so that they can find you) and targeted advertising on the other end (Facebook, Google Adsense). Usually, if they are willing and actively looking, they are capable of paying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4) Gauge value by negotiating on price with these customers in order to establish how far off your mental value is. There are many ways to do this, I personally tend to start about 30 percent lower than the mental value price I have decided and incrementally increase 5-10 percent for each successive customer. This may be too conservative of a strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5) Partition your customers in cohorts. In my opinion, this is critical. The information you gain from your first cohort will give you valuable insight on how to price your second cohort, and segment your product lines based on buyer personas. Workshop your product as much as possible in your early stages. This usually means offering full feature access to gauge customer behavior. Knowing this consumer behavior allows price optimization. By your second and third cohorts, you no longer want to be offering full user access; by then you should have a solid idea of what types of buyers prefer what features, and you can segment your product. This is far superior than the arbitrary segmentation that I discussed in the first post (high, medium, low, with most of the attention and sales being focused on the medium tier). As an aside, this is referred to as a Goldilocks strategy, and in my opinion, it doesn't segment properly based on the customer landscape idea I discussed in the first post. You want your tiers to represent optimal value for each of your customer personas so that you can charge optimal price. In our fitness business, we expect that age will be an important factor in feature selection. Some of our younger customers in this first cohort will be more interested in a hormonal analysis to increase muscle gain, more intensive workouts, etc. Our older customers will be more interested in losing fat, fixing posture, eating well, not having long-term health issues, perhaps features like DNA analysis, etc. Our goal is to segment our product offerings based on concrete evidence of those buyer personas. Partitioning allows you to make those tier changes quickly (3-6 month increments).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6)  Ignore free users unless you plan to have the full version of your pricing model include a free tier.  If you are building a user base around a paid offering, the advice given by your "free beta customers" should be taken with a huge grain of salt.  I believe this mainly because I don't think they fit your ideal customer profile. You are looking for customers who value your offering enough to pay for it. Free customers, especially if they are unlikely to convert to paid ones, are not your ideal customer. If no one is willing to pay for your product, then that could indicate a variety of things about the health of your business. Perhaps that means you may need to rethink your axes of differentiation, or do more market research, or rebuild your pricing model to incorporate new information. In some very unfortunate cases, a lack of paying customers can mean a complete rethink of the product/service you are offering. But in most cases, your free customers are just freeloaders, and if you are aiming to run a business where there are no free tiers, or you cannot get any of them to convert to a paid tier within a set timeframe (maybe 3-6 months, this is up to you to decide), then you should view them as being customers you do not actually want. This means you should view their user experience stories and advice as irrelevant. This sounds controversial (and perhaps I am wrong) but my intuition is that a paid SaaS business does not try to go after the entire market, it intentionally cuts itself off in order to make itself more valuable for a target customer. If a SaaS business does aim to go wide, it builds different product/service lines to serve different portions of the market.  For example, in our fitness business, if a free customer or onlooker tells us that a workout is too difficult or that the intensity is too high, I tend to ignore the advice because that person has not indicated that they are anywhere near my ideal customer. If someone in our paid first cohort told us that then we would take it very seriously and adapt our service based on their advice.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this process gives more of a feedback on the very fundamentals around price optimization, and touches on segmenting your market based on external usage and information, as opposed to some internal metric that is unlikely to be accurate.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This (once again extremely long) post touched on the variability of  early pricing and how to think about the value of your service through differentiation. Once again, all of it is based on my own experiences and research over the years. We did not touch on many other technical details of building a marketing strategy as they are long enough to be their own set of posts. We also didn't discuss product success. None of this will matter if your company cannot actually solve the problem at the heart of your ideal customer. The next few parts of this series of posts (which will be released on and off over the next 6 months) will touch on each of these processes in some details.</p>

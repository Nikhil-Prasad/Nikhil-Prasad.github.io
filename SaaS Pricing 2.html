    <p>In the last part, my aim was to take a very high level view at the prominent SaaS pricing models. This next part is meant to delve deeper into the decision making processes that you use when faced with these contexts.</p>
<h2>End Points</h2>
<p>Price (and the model around it)  is an end point in some ways. It should be thought of as a function of your knowledge about your customer, what value you provide to them, and your general place in the market.   It means that you've figured out as much else possible about your business and how you aim to position yourself in the market  This sounds good in theory, but in reality, its very hard to do because knowledge of the market is opaque.</p>
<p>I think of this as an optimization problem. Perhaps a better analogy is gradient descent in machine learning. To keep it non-technical, think of the process of pricing as trying to navigate down a mountain. You are at the top of a mountain at night. Its pitch black and all you have is a flashlight that sees forward a few feet. If your goal is to get down to the base of the mountain, one way to do so effectively is to point your flashlight down towards the ground, and following the steepest downward incline slowly for a few steps. Periodically you stop and check again to see if you're following the steepest incline. Eventually, by continuing to optimize your rate of descent, you should reach the bottom of the mountain (with some caveats that are not relevant here). Pricing sort of works the same way. If you think of your optimal price as being at the "bottom of the mountain" you sort of have to be willing to pick a price, learn from your customers about what they are willing to pay, and more critically, how they value the product, and then continue shifting that price slowly. That becomes your process of "descending down the mountain".</p>
<p>However, even with the understanding that pricing is an iterative process that requires constant shifting based on information you receive from taking to your customers, you should still have a solid starting point.  As mentioned before, this requires having as good of an understanding of the market and your business as possible before entering the iterative stages.</p>
<h2>Three Common Pricing strategies</h2>
<p>There are 3 ways to think about setting your price:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cost Plus Based Pricing- in this pricing framework, a company calculates its variable costs, with a margin of error introduced, and then adds a 15 to 20 percent margin to that in order to create profit. This sort of pricing model is common in commodity industries, where the value of a good is set in some sort of equilibrium. Gasoline is an example of a product that is cost plus priced, and all competitors kind of aggregate around that price. Commodity industries create enormous downward price pressure, as competitors will continue to undercut each other in a brutal race to the bottom (with some caveats about markets and monopolies). In this sort of industry, margins are small, and you need scale to achieve profitability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Competitor Based Pricing-  This one is pretty self explanatory. You base your pricing by looking around at your competition  in the industry.  Dynamics of this are present in every industry, one can look at consumer cars and their model lines as an example of this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Value Based Pricing-  This is the type of pricing model that was described above, where the focus is clearly on determining what value you provide to your customer, and pricing against that.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Cost based and competitor based pricing are tangentially useful for SaaS companies, but they are not fundamentally the right fit for deciding your actual pricing model.  SaaS is unique because of how differentiated software can be.  A SaaS Company that wants to be successful should have a sufficient degree of differentiation, because it is critical that it serve its own niche and become less price sensitive.  If you are not sufficiently differentiated from the rest of the market within your industry, then you are already doomed to fail, especially if you are trying to reach scale.  To be clear, this is not to imply that you should not be looking at what your competitors are doing, just that competition in it of itself in the software industry is usually a death sentence, especially if you are trying to start small and play catch up. If you are in an industry where your product is similar to someone else already in the field, you need to quickly find a point of differentiation that appeals to customers. Otherwise there is no way that you can create any sort of competitive advantage.</p>
<p>This is an issue once again that we had in the regulatory compliance space at the financial software company that I had mentioned in the previous post. Our software platform, while being targeted at financial institutions, was very similar in its technological scope to Palantir early on. This caused us problems in certain meetings, as companies would ask what made us different than palantir, and our truthful answer was that we were a less advanced version of them that could be offered at a much cheaper rate (Palantir charge upwards of a million dollar per month for their product line and has spent hundred of millions of dollars in product development. We had spent hundreds of thousands...in order to give you an idea of the resource difference). Our point of differentiation eventually became shifting the product to be a complete suite of resources aimed at mid-sized insurance companies and banks that were being underserved by big software companies. Over here we could compete, because there were few few (if any) players that had adequately built software targeting these banks, yet there was still a need.</p>
<p>This example should also elucidate why, as I was saying earlier, knowing your ideal customer and the market is an input of pricing. Price for us became an endpoint. We only formalized it after we had went to many customer meetings and learned more about where exactly our ideal market position was.</p>
<p>The main reason that I think competitor based pricing is a useful exercise to do for SaaS, but ultimately flawed as a pricing model is that you want to be serving your own niche of customers who become loyal to you because you are differentiated on some vector. Otherwise you are just a copycat, and one who provides no real incentives for customers to utilize your service anyway.</p>
<p>Cost plus based pricing is also flawed for SaaS companies as an underlying model, mainly because it undercuts your profit margin by making a mistake about customers assumptions. In a commodity based industry, there is downward pressure on your costs because one of your competitors will keep cutting their profit margin down to be as close to cost as possible. The equilibrium price usually settles at some point above your costs (unless there are monopoly or duopoly situations where supply is controlled by only one or two parties.). Software, especially highly differentiated software is not a commodity. Customers don't really care about the costs that you incur, and you should be offering something that is differentiated enough that they are there because they cannot get it anywhere else. In reality, that is the fundamental reason that both cost-plus based and customer based pricing are bad fits for SaaS; your differentiation level makes it so that your ideal customers are coming because ideally you provide value that no one else can. And your price should be reflective of that value.</p>
<p>To be clear, think of cost plus based pricing and competitor based pricing as "checks" for the value you ascribe to your product. But they are just checks, not fundamental markers to decide what your product is worth.</p>
<p>So value based pricing it is. This leads us to our next question. How do you determine the value your customers accrue? We discussed this at a high level in the previous section, but I want to delve more into details here.</p>
<h2>Valuable Considerations</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the endpoints section, you start off your value based pricing by trying to get as close to what you think ideal value is, and then iterating from there.</p>
<p>There are certain things you must begin with for deciding value. The first and most critical one is your ideal customer. You can have different ideal customers for different product offerings (if you sell multiple product lines) but before you even come close to understanding the value you offer, you have to understand the customer that you are offering it to.</p>
<p>Understanding your ideal customer is  a function of understanding your product.   When you built your product, who were you targeting? What problem of theirs were you actually trying to solve? This is the most critical point. A lot of times, as software developers or product development people, we get lost in features and ancillary nonsense. And as business people, we get lost in metrics (ARR, LTV, etc). These are clearly important (and they come later in the stack), but the key thing you are trying to do is to solve a problem. Often times this problem has literally nothing to do with the features of your product. Your product/service offers a "means" for them to achieve this goal, to solve this problem.</p>
<p>At the earliest stages of your company, before you have factored in Customer acquisition costs, and built a marketing funnel, figured out churn, etc, you have to factor your pricing as a function of your ideal customer.</p>
<p>I'll explain it with an example. I am currently attempting to build a fitness business that is not technically a SaaS company, but has so many software elements that I will call it software adjacent.  This is a business that I am building with my friend, who is a competitive powerlifter who has gone from being very much out of shape to someone who is an athlete. Him and I have spent a lot of time talking about motivation and fitness, and out of that a desire to build a small personal training business was born. We are currently in the beginning stages, with the product and plans developed, and 5 paying customers, but are workshopping our ideal customers and price. We have developed a roadmap to a lot of features for a software based workout and nutrition calendar app that allows for direct communication with him as a personal trainer, but are not sure exactly what features each customer would or would not like to use.</p>
<p>During our discussions on trying to figure out how to price this thing, we both decided that a lot of our competitors (remote training and workout apps and programs) were a waste of time because they were not actually solving the problem that most people who signed up were looking for. Or rather, we did not want our ideal customer to be someone who paid 5-10 dollars a month for a bullshit app that gave you workouts that you could find for free online and cookie-cutter nutrition information. We also felt that fitness apps, like dating apps, should have a natural churn if they were high quality i.e. once you get into the shape that you want (or found the person that you wanted to date), you leave. This is a difficult thing to accept, but ideally we did not want people paying us 10 dollars a month for years on end with minimal results results (aka most gyms and fitness programs in the market). In our minds, there were a class of people that were desperate to be in the best shape of their lives, whether this involved becoming an athlete, or going from obese to slim and that their value of a service that could get them there and make them self sufficient in a set time frame would be astronomical.  We decided that we wanted to create a program that was fixed cost (hence not actually a recurring service) that guaranteed results within 6 months. We would cut everyone else out because we did not want to target them. This also allowed us to charge at such a price (1000+ dollars over the six months) that we could build out the services that we felt would make us capable of actually delivering on this six month promise.</p>
<p>So in our minds, our ideal price was a fixed cost of 1000-1500 dollars for this service. This was the "starting point" that we'd decided, basically just from my friend's experience as a personal trainer, and conversations we had with potential customers and competitor analysis. We also did a quick cost analysis of our marginal costs for such a product in order to set a floor. To refer back to the 3 models, this is how a SaaS (or SaaS adjacent business) would utilize cost based pricing and competitor based pricing. They are just informational tools to set a floor and a ceiling perhaps for your value based assessment of your product. But our price had been set based on our value assessment and our ideal customer profile, which was based on their "problem to be solved".</p>
<p>This price was the "top of our mountain" , to refer back to the gradient descent analogy. Our goal now was to optimize it, and to also segment the customer profile even further (we are still in the process of doing this).</p>
<p>The way to go about this is external. You have to communicate with customers and continously adapt your prices and (if you're using a tiered model like we plan to) your tiers based on feedback.</p>
<p>Process wise, the way to do this is in cohorts. Take a time frame (usually 3-6 months, we picked 6 as it fits nicely with our product description of 6 months to self sufficiency), and decided to go after 5-10 people in that cohort that all had the goal of solving our "ideal customer problem" i.e. I want to get into the best shape of my life and have it last.  </p>
<p>The initial step was reaching out to people within our own networks who we knew fit that ideal customer profile. Within 2 weeks we had 5 paying customers. The first one we started a bit lower, and asked for 450 dollars for the 6 months, which we were ok with because it was very early in the process. Once we had a commitment from him, we started bumping the price up 10-15 percent for each successive customer to see how far we could go (this is the optimization step). We eventually reached a tentative commitment at 900 dollars over the 6 months.</p>
<p>Obviously the price can be further optimized. Optimization is best executed as a two step process. The first step is within cohorts (as I explained above). The second step (which we will get to in 6 months when this cohort is done) is about learning a lot about user behaviors. We do not expect everyone who shares the "ideal customer problem" to have the same "path" to getting there. That is to say, that while all of our first cohort customers want the same thing out of this process, some of them are different. Because we have ideally positioned ourselves at the top of this market by going after customers that value a specific result very highly, we plan to introduce a host of features that are not economically feasible in lower range offerings (personalized exercise plans based on fitness level, body fat and weight management, hormonal management, DNA analysis for exercise genes, motivational content, in depth nutritional guides broken down by metabolic effectiveness, targeted day by day workouts, direct personal trainer access, form analysis, etc) . By picking a diverse cohort, we can then naturally see which of these features are most used by which type of group.</p>
<p>This allows us to naturally create buyer personas based on feature usage. If you remember back to part 1 of this post, where I discussed how tiered pricing can be very diverse, this is what I was referring to. Tiers (if you use them) should not be segmented based on arbitrary feature guidelines, but rather should be a result of what you learn about your buyers feature usage over time. As you see which buyers utilize what features more than others, you can naturally start segmenting your product features based on buyer personas that you build slowly. And then you can map price to the customer geography. This is our plan over the next 6 months.</p>
<p>I spoke very much about this fitness example in order to give a real world use case of how I think about pricing over time. To formalize it, when you think of pricing as an endpoint, you should follow these steps in some rough order:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1) Begin by doing as much market research as possible. Calculate your costs and do research on competitors to establish guideposts for where your pricing can be i.e. use cost plus based pricing and competitor based pricing to set guideposts for your value based pricing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2) Figure out your axes of differentiation and where you position yourself in the market. For us its my friends' brand and reputation, along with our desire to provide a service that is guaranteed to make you fit and self sufficient within 6 months by being at the top of the market. Your own business could be at a completely different place in your respective market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3) Find people who's problems you are actually solving and position yourself to be their ideal solution. You do this partly by experience and intuition in the field. But ideally the characteristics I look for are customers who's need to have this problem solved is very apparent (for example, very fat people for our fitness business, pardon my bluntness), and who are very aware that their problem exists and are perhaps actively looking for solutions. In our early stages, this involves us reaching out into our networks and finding people who fit this profile, but for any company this is going to require SEO on one end (so that they can find you) and targeted advertising on the other end (facebook, google ad sense, perhaps youtube). Usually if they are willing and actively looking, they are going to be capable of paying. From this standpoint, SEO is critical. This however, could be its own post, so I will leave it at generalities.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4) Gauge the value you're offering them by negotiating on price with them in order to establish how far off your mental value is. There are many ways to do this, I personally tend to start about 30 percent lower than the mental value price I have decided and incrementally increase 5-10 percent for each successive customer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5) Partition your customers in cohorts. In my opinion, this is critical. The information you gain from your first cohort will give you valuable insight on how to price your second cohort, and segment your product lines based on buyer personas. Early on in your business, you want to workshop as much as possible about your product, and the way to do that is to start with a few solid points and experiment with the rest. This usually means offering full access to all of your features in order to gauge customer behavior and decide your price optimization and your pricing model from that knowledge. By your second and third cohorts, you no longer want to be offering full user access; by then you should have a solid idea of what types of buyers prefer what features, and you can segment your product offering based on that knowledge, as opposed to the arbitrary  segmenting that I discussed in the first post (high, medium, low, with most of the attention and sales being focused on the medium tier). As an aside, this is referred to as a goldilocks strategy, and in my opinion, it doesn't segment properly based on the customer landscape idea I discussed in the first post. You want your tiers to represent optimal value for each of your customer personas, so that you can charge optimal price. For example for our fitness business, we expect that age will be an important factor in feature selection. Some of our younger customers in this first cohort will be more interested in hormonal analysis to increase muscle gain, more intensive workouts, and more information on stuff that is more looks based. Our older customers will be more interested in losing fat, fixing posture, eating well, not having long term health issues, perhaps features like DNA analysis, etc. Our goal is to segment our product offerings based on concrete evidence of those buyer personas. Partitioning allows you to make those tier changes quickly (3-6 month increments).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6) Do not pay attention to free beta users unless your business model is based on ad revenue or freemium. That is to say, do not pay attention to free users unless you plan to have the full version of your pricing model include a free tier.  If you are building a user base around a paid offering, the advice given by your "free beta customers" should be taken with a huge grain of salt.  I believe this mainly because I don't think they fit your ideal customer profile.  Based on the logic of value pricing, you are looking for customers who actually value your offering enough to pay some price for it. Free customers, especially if they are refusing to ever convert to paid ones, are not your ideal customer. If no one is willing to pay for your product, then that could indicate a variety of things about the health of your business. Perhaps that means you may need to rethink your axes of differentiation, or do more market research, or rebuild your pricing model to incorporate new information. For example, no one wanted to (or ever will want to) pay for Facebook, but they did a good job of monetizing usage against advertising dollars, and found a user base that was willing to pay very heavily for consumer interest (advertisers). Perhaps your business needs to find a pricing model resembling that. In some very unfortunate cases, a lack of paying customers can mean a complete rethink of the product/service you are offering. But in most cases, your free customers are just freeloaders, and if you are aiming to run a business where there are no free tiers, or you cannot get any of them to convert to a paid tier within a set timeframe (maybe 3-6 months, this is up to you to decide), then you should view them as being customers you do not actually want. This means you should view their user experience stories and advice as near irrelevant. I think this sounds controversial (and perhaps I am wrong) but my intuition is that a paid SaaS business does not try to go after the entire market, it intentionally cuts itself off in order to make themselves more valuable for a target customer. If a SaaS business does aim to go wide, it builds different product/service lines to serve different portions of the market.  For example, in our fitness business, if a free customer or onlooker tells us that a workout is too difficult or that the intensity is too high, I tend to ignore the advice because that person has not indicated that they are anywhere near my ideal customer. If someone in our paid first cohort told us that then we would take it very seriously and adapt the service based on their advice. This is why actually we didn't open up the service's first cohort to any free users (just had early user stories with friends who might be interested). Our long term business goals do not include having a free tier at this time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This (once again extremely long) post touched on more of the variability of deciding early pricing and how to think about the value of your service through differentiation. Once again, all of it is based on my own experiences and research over the years. We did not get too much into detail on customer acquisition, or any of the mathematical or technical details of how to build a sustainable customer acquisition process. That is long enough to be its own set of posts as well. Of course, we also didn't talk about how to ensure that your product is actually successful at solving their problems. None of this will matter if your company cannot deliver. The next few parts of this series of posts (which will be released on and off over the next 6 months) will touch on each of these processes in some details.</p>
